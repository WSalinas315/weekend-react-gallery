## Installation

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Create a database named "react_gallery".
3. Run the SQL queries in the database.sql file to set up a table and populate it. This project was made with Postgres and Postico and will work nicely with that duo.
4. From your terminal run 'npm install'.
5. Then run 'npm run server' and 'npm run client' within separate terminal instances. This should automatically open a window in your browser.
